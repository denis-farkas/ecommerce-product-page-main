## My process

Simulating a real process consulting an API with axios and data in json. useParams() was not used because there is only one product. But I tried to respect the future existence of various products in the code's logic, with context and reducers.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- useContext with useReducer

### Continued development

I'm not completely comfortable with optimizing react under useContext and useReducer. Need to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Shopping Cart Built in React JS with Context API and useReducer](https://github.com/piyush-eon/React-shopping-cart-context-with-reducer) - This helped me a lot with useReducer.
